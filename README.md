## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Example: View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- Example: See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

Additional customization and enhancements

- Updated design, typography, layout
- Use of dialog and modal elements
- Symantic forms with basic client-side form validation


### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Continued experience with CSS Grid and Flexbox. 

#### Results section - home page

Given this section is meant to simulate a list of search results, it seemed important semantically to make this an unordered list. 

At first look of the design comp, it seemed like Grid was the best option to produce the offset layout of each result item. However, once I began experimenting, Flexbox ended up a cleaner and more efficient solution. I simply needed to allow the images in each list item to grow naturally and proportionately and utilize the order property on the 2nd list item's image to produce the offset effect, with minimal code.


Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
